# EVM Deployer Boilerplate 🚀

Welcome to **VM Deployer BoilerplateUE**! This repository provides a base framework to help you easily deploy EVM across various platforms, utilizing automation, modular configurations, and integration with blockchain ecosystems for an enhanced deployment experience.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Modular & Customizable Setup**: Build your EVM deployments with ease and flexibility.
- **Automated Deployment Scripts**: Save time by deploying VMs with a single command.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Whether you're on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or self-hosted environments — this boilerplate works across platforms.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with blockchain networks like **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, and **Polygon** to add decentralized features to your VM deployments.
- **Credibility**: Leverage blockchain for transparency, creating trust in the deployment process.

---

## 💡 Economic Mechanics

The deployment process incorporates a *tokenized* system designed to enhance both the economic and credibility aspects:

- **Tokenized Deployment**: Use your native token for deploying VMs, adding a layer of financial incentive and decentralization.
- **Staking**: Users can stake tokens to ensure priority access and faster deployment times.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Deploy VMs as part of a marketplace where users can trade VM instances or resources using **ERC-20** tokens.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Integrate VM deployment with DeFi protocols to create a decentralized infrastructure that is fully transparent and incentivized.

💰 **How It Works**:

- Deployments can be made using **ETH** or your own project’s **token** (on networks like **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, or **Polygon**).
- Staking or paying with tokens grants access to premium services, including faster processing and additional features.
- Fees are paid directly to smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.
- Need a fully functional Layer 1 blockchain? You can easily set up your own **Proof of Stake (PoS) Devnet** using Docker by following this [guide](https://rauljordan.com/how-to-setup-a-proof-of-stake-devnet/), enabling you to run your own blockchain network for VM deployments.

## 📈 Credibility Mechanisms

We believe in *trust through transparency*. By integrating blockchain technology, we ensure that every VM deployment and resource usage is publicly verifiable on-chain.

- **Smart Contracts**: Every transaction, from deployment to staking, is managed through transparent smart contracts on **Ethereum** or **Arbitrum**.
- **Decentralization**: A decentralized VM network ensures that no single entity controls the deployment process — ensuring fairness and reliability.
- **NFT Certificates**: Each successful deployment creates a verifiable **NFT** certificate, showing that the deployment was made in a secure and trustworthy manner.

## 🔗 Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Integration**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon (ERC-20 tokens, DeFi, and NFTs)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Virtualization**: Docker, VMware, VirtualBox
- **Automation**: Docker compose, Bash Scripts, Yarn
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org).
- **Yarn**: Install Yarn using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn
    ```
- **Docker**: Install Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Hardhat**: Install Hardhat using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g hardhat
    ```


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/netzulo/evm-deployer-boilerplateue.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd evm-deployer-boilerplateue
