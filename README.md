# EVM Deployer Boilerplate 🚀

Welcome to **EVM Deployer Boilerplate**! This repository provides a base framework to help you easily deploy EVM across various platforms, utilizing automation, modular configurations, and integration with blockchain ecosystems for an enhanced deployment experience.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Modular & Customizable Setup**: Build your EVM deployments with ease and flexibility.
- **Automated Deployment Scripts**: Save time by deploying Smart contracts with a single command.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Whether you're on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or self-hosted environments — this boilerplate works across platforms.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with blockchain networks like **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, and **Polygon** to add decentralized features to your EVM deployments.
- **Credibility**: Leverage blockchain for transparency, creating trust in the deployment process.

---

## 💡 Economic Mechanics

The deployment process incorporates a *tokenized* system designed to enhance both the economic and credibility aspects:

- **Tokenized Deployment**: Use your native token for deploying Smart contracts, adding a layer of financial incentive and decentralization.
- **Staking**: Users can stake tokens to ensure priority access and faster deployment times.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Deploy Smart contracts as part of a marketplace where users can trade EVM instances or resources using **ERC-20** tokens.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Integrate VM deployment with DeFi protocols to create a decentralized infrastructure that is fully transparent and incentivized.

💰 **How It Works**:

- Deployments can be made using **ETH** or your own project’s **token** (on networks like **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, or **Polygon**).
- Staking or paying with tokens grants access to premium services, including faster processing and additional features.
- Fees are paid directly to smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.
- Need a fully functional Layer 1 blockchain? You can easily set up your own **Proof of Stake (PoS) Devnet** using Docker by following this [guide](https://rauljordan.com/how-to-setup-a-proof-of-stake-devnet/), enabling you to run your own blockchain network for VM deployments.


---

## 📈 Credibility Mechanisms

We believe in *trust through transparency*. By integrating blockchain technology, we ensure that every VM deployment and resource usage is publicly verifiable on-chain.

- **Smart Contracts**: Every transaction, from deployment to staking, is managed through transparent smart contracts on **Ethereum** or **Arbitrum**.
- **Decentralization**: A decentralized VM network ensures that no single entity controls the deployment process — ensuring fairness and reliability.
- **NFT Certificates**: Each successful deployment creates a verifiable **NFT** certificate, showing that the deployment was made in a secure and trustworthy manner.

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud

## 🐋 Docker

Docker is a key component of this boilerplate, enabling you to create isolated environments for your EVM deployments. By using Docker, you can ensure consistency across different development and production environments.

###  With Docker CLI

1. **Build Docker Image**:
    Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image.
    ```bash
    docker build -t evm-deployer .
    ```

2. **Run Docker Container**:
    Start a Docker container using the built image.
    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm --name evm-deployer-container evm-deployer
    ```

### With Docker Compose

For more complex setups, you can use Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications.

1. **Start Services**:
    Use Docker Compose to start all required services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

2. **Stop Services**:
    Stop the services when you are done.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down --rmi all
    ```

By leveraging Docker, you can streamline your development workflow and ensure that your EVM deployments are consistent and reproducible across different environments.
