# EVM Deployer Boilerplate üöÄ

Welcome to **EVM Deployer Boilerplate**! This repository provides a base framework to help you easily deploy EVM across various platforms, utilizing automation, modular configurations, and integration with blockchain ecosystems for an enhanced deployment experience.

---

## üåü Features

- **Multi-Network Compatibility**:  Connect and deploy contracts seamlessly to major blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, and more. Includes support for test networks like Goerli and Mumbai for staging environments.

- **Modular & Customizable Setup**: Easily configure contract paths, artifacts, and testing directories. The boilerplate is designed to adapt to various deployment needs and environments.

- **Automated Deployment & Verification**: Save time with predefined scripts for deploying and verifying contracts on multiple networks using a single command.

- **Real-Time Contract Monitoring**: Leverage the watcher feature to automatically detect changes in contracts and trigger recompilation, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

- **Smart Contract Optimization**: Built-in Solidity optimizer and contract sizer ensure your contracts are efficient and fit within network size limits.

- **Comprehensive Testing & Coverage**: Includes tools for writing robust tests and measuring code coverage, ensuring high-quality smart contracts.

- **Preconfigured Accounts & Local Networks**: Local networks (`hardhat` and `devnet`) come with preloaded accounts and customizable mining settings for testing diverse scenarios.

- **Blockchain Explorer Integration**: Verify your contracts directly on explorers like Etherscan, Polygonscan, and more, with support for custom chains and APIs.

- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: This boilerplate is compatible with AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and self-hosted environments, making it suitable for any infrastructure setup.

## üí° Smart Contracts Examples

The deployment process incorporates a *smarts contracts* system designed to enhance both the economic and credibility aspects:

- [ ] **Lending & Borrowing Protocols**: Develop integrations for Smart contract deployment financing using decentralized lending.
- [ ] **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Facilitate the trade of tokens and resources within the ecosystem using built-in marketplace utilities.
- [ ] **Yield Farming & Staking**: Enable users to earn rewards by staking tokens or providing liquidity for deployment transactions.
- [ ] **Decentralized Insurance**: Offer protection for Smart contract deployments through tokenized insurance pools.
- [ ] **Tokenized Governance**: Allow token holders to participate in governance decisions, including deployment prioritization or ecosystem upgrades.
- [ ] **Asset Tokenization**: Tokenize deployment configurations or resources to trade as unique digital assets.
- [ ] **Cross-Chain Solutions**: Implement interoperability for deployments across multiple blockchain networks.
- [ ] **Play-to-Earn (P2E) Models**: Introduce gamified mechanics, allowing users to earn rewards for participating in deployment-related activities.

| # | Contract Name | Description |
|---|---------------|-------------|
| ‚úîÔ∏è | `MAC.sol`     | **Managed Access Control**: A contract that manages access control allowing external backend manage the contract. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | `UserCreditToken.sol` | **User Credit Token**: An ERC-20 token contract that provides credit for deployment transactions and use MAC permissions. |


üí∞ **How It Works**:

- Deployments can be made using **ETH** or your own project‚Äôs **token** (on networks like **Ethereum**, **Arbitrum**, or **Polygon**).
- Staking or paying with tokens grants access to premium services, including faster processing and additional features.
- Fees are paid directly to smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.
- Need a fully functional Layer 1 blockchain? You can easily set up your own **Proof of Stake (PoS) Devnet** using Docker by following this [guide](https://rauljordan.com/how-to-setup-a-proof-of-stake-devnet/), enabling you to run your own blockchain network for VM deployments.

## üìà Credibility Mechanisms

We believe in *trust through transparency*. By integrating blockchain technology, we ensure that every VM deployment and resource usage is publicly verifiable on-chain.

- **Smart Contracts**: Every transaction, from deployment to staking, is managed through transparent smart contracts on **Ethereum** or **Arbitrum**.
- **Decentralization**: A decentralized VM network ensures that no single entity controls the deployment process ‚Äî ensuring fairness and reliability.
- **NFT Certificates**: Each successful deployment creates a verifiable **NFT** certificate, showing that the deployment was made in a secure and trustworthy manner.

## üîó Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Integration**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon (ERC-20 tokens, DeFi, and NFTs)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Virtualization**: Docker, VMware, VirtualBox

## üêã Docker

Docker is a key component of this boilerplate, enabling you to create isolated environments for your EVM deployments. By using Docker, you can ensure consistency across different development and production environments.

###  With Docker CLI

1. **Build Docker Image**:
    Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image.
    ```bash
    docker build -t evm-deployer .
    ```

2. **Run Docker Container**:
    Start a Docker container using the built image.
    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm --name evm-deployer-container evm-deployer
    ```

### With Docker Compose

For more complex setups, you can use Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications.

1. **Start Services**:
    Use Docker Compose to start all required services.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

2. **Stop Services**:
    Stop the services when you are done.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down --rmi all
    ```

By leveraging Docker, you can streamline your development workflow and ensure that your EVM deployments are consistent and reproducible across different environments.
